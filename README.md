## 🗣 Feedback Welcome

If you use this framework, or even just sit with it for a bit, I'd love your feedback.
What made sense? What didn't? What did/would you add or change? 
I truly believe this kind of work gets better when it’s shared and tested in the real world. This isn’t a final answer—it’s a living tool.
