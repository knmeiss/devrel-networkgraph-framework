## ðŸ—£ Feedback Welcome

If you use this model, or even just sit with it for a bit, I'd love your feedback.
What made sense? What didn't? What did/would you add or change? 
I truly believe this kind of work gets better when itâ€™s shared and tested in the real world. This isnâ€™t a final answerâ€”itâ€™s a living tool.
